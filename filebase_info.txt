Looking at schema/rules/files/raw in terms of making our data objects.

Data object: 
    group linked data in python object. This would contain raw data, associated jsons and tsvs, etc...

How this would look like in practice:
    User submits a request to create a "data object" needs to input stuff like:
        entities - maybe not
        suffix
        datatype
        modality

it seems what is really necessary is defining datatype and suffix

it appears, if no suffix is given, then suffix == datatype

At the moment my dilemas is mainly centered on knowing the associated files for some data.
    this includes files like the:
        _coordsystem
        _channels
        _electrodes
        _optodes
        _events
        _stim
        _physio

Possibly thinking of using schema.meta.associations to find associated extra files, but this only includes:
        _events
        _aslcontext
        _m0scan
        _magnitude
        _magnitude1
        _channels
        _coordsystem
        _electrodes


possible hardcoded solution:
    have an option when adding data or subject etc... to create addititonal, i.e. nData = data(events=True, physio=True)
    this will additionally add in those blocks with the correct suffix..
