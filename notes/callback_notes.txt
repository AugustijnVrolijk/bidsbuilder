add builder
 
At the moment of writing this: 04/8/2025
I want the following 4 types:
    CallbackField
    CallbackContainer
        where I can attach specific callbacks to specific instances. (for none child callbacks)
    SingleCallbackField
    SingleCallbackContainer 
        where a single predefined callback is applied to every instance (for callbacks being affect children)

rather than make the myself distinguish

use mixins or a metaclass to dynamically create these

i.e. 
attribute = callback(container=(true/false), single=(true/false), fget, fval, etc....)

Need to look at an effecient way of doing this.
